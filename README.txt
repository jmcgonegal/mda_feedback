This is a website feedback module for Drupal 7 that uses the Webforms module to allow users to submit website feedback similar to the way Google Plus works.

You can access the configuration settings for this module at /admin/content/mda_feedback

The mda_feedback module needs to have hidden field keys called highlight_box and path added to the webform you select. You should also include a textarea with a field key named description.
