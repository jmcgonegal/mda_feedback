This is a website feedback module for Drupal 7 that uses the Webforms module 
to allow users to submit website feedback similar to the way Google Plus 
works.

You can access the configuration settings for this module at 
/admin/content/mda_feedback

The module won't show until you select one from /admin/content/mda_feedback

The mda_feedback module needs to have hidden field keys called highlight_box, 
client, description, and path added to the webform you select.
